This is a project to use an android phone as the brain for a [Mech-Warfare](http://mech-warfare.com/default.aspx) robot.  The phone sends video and sensor data back via UDP and TCP to a [Processing](http://processing.org) app that displays the video and accepts input from a Playstation 3 controller.  The phone receives the  controller data and relays it via bluetooth to an [Adrunio](http://www.arduino.cc) or Basic Stamp controller which controls the servos and motors for moving the robot.

The goal is to create a semi-autonomous robot that can navigate without bumping into walls and locate special target markers visually.

Here is a [video of the robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeZ3R38d3Cg)

This project would not be possible without the work of so many great open source projects:

[KryoNet](http://code.google.com/p/kryonet/)  -- Very fast and easy to use java networking, serialization and RMI lib.

[Processing](http://processing.org/)  -- Ultra easy to use graphics and multimedia programing environment. You wont believe it's java!

[AndAR -- Android Augmented Reality](http://code.google.com/p/andar/) -- A a port of artoolkit for android.

[SipDroid](http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/) -- VOIP for android.

[The Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/) -- Thanks Google!


There may be other projects I am forgetting, So I will credit the open source community as a whole for making what was once impossible merely difficult!  To anyone who has ever released source thank you.
